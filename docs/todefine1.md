By "type of clients" I mean understanding your target audience demographics and characteristics, such as:

## Demographics
- **Age groups**: Parents with young children? Adults with new allergies? Teens?
- **Income level**: Are you targeting premium clients or accessible pricing?
- **Location**: Local only or willing to do virtual consultations?

## Problem Types
- **Severity**: People with severe allergies vs. mild intolerances?
- **Allergy types**: Food allergies, environmental, skin reactions?
- **Urgency**: Emergency cases vs. preventive care?

## Client Journey Stage
- **Newly diagnosed** people who need guidance
- **Struggling with management** of existing allergies
- **Parents seeking help** for their children
- **People wanting testing** vs. already diagnosed

## Why This Matters for Your Strategy

Looking at your action plan, knowing your ideal client helps determine:

- **Ad targeting**: Different keywords and demographics for Google/FB ads
- **Content focus**: Blog topics that resonate with their specific problems
- **Instagram strategy**: What testimonials/videos would most appeal to them
- **Pricing strategy**: Whether to collect payment before/after consultation
- **Appointment tool**: Complexity needed based on client tech-savviness

For example:
- If targeting **worried parents**, focus on child safety content and Facebook ads
- If targeting **young adults**, Instagram and quick educational videos work better
- If targeting **premium clients**, emphasize expertise and collect payment upfront
